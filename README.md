# 📰 NYT Title Generation Project 📚

### 📝 Overview
This project focuses on creating a **machine learning model** to automatically generate concise and engaging news titles from article abstracts using the **New York Times (NYT) dataset**. The goal is to produce titles that effectively capture the essence of the articles by leveraging advanced **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques.

### 🌟 Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implements robust data cleaning and preparation techniques for the NYT dataset.
- **Model Training**: Uses a combination of **LSTM/GRU** networks with **attention mechanisms** to grasp the context and semantics of the abstracts.
- **Title Generation**: Utilizes a **pointer-generator network** to produce both extractive and abstractive titles, enhancing title summarization accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Applies **BLEU** and **ROUGE** scores to evaluate the performance of generated titles against human-written ones.

### 📊 Tools & Technologies:
- **Python 🐍**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **LSTM/GRU Networks**
- **Pointer-Generator Networks**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **BLEU, ROUGE Metrics**

### 🚀 How to Use:
1. **Clone the repository** and install the required dependencies.
2. Load and preprocess the **NYT dataset** for model training.
3. Train the **LSTM/GRU model** with attention mechanisms and evaluate the performance using **BLEU** and **ROUGE** scores.
4. Generate automatic news titles for new article abstracts using the trained model.

This project showcases the power of **deep learning** in summarization and title generation, offering a solution that can be extended to various domains beyond news articles.
